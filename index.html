<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>Welcome to my website!</p>

<p>Occasionally I write blog posts about topics I'm interested in. My current
   interests are Rust, Haskell, and functional programming, but I will also
   explore other tech-related topics when I have something to say about them.
</p>
   
<p>I hope that you enjoy reading my posts!</p>
