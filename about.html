<p>Hi, I'm Nolan. I'm a software developer with a passion for functional programming,
Haskell, and Rust. I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a major
in Computer Science and a minor in Religious Studies. When I'm not writing code or
blog posts, I enjoy watching art house films and cheering on my favourite sports
teams.</p>
