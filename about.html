<img src="/images/pic.png"/>

<p>Hey, I'm Nolan. I'm a software developer with a passion for functional programming and
type safety. </p>

<p> Naturally this has led me towards languages like Haskell and Rust,
but lately I have been enjoying programming in Elixir and reaping the benefits of 
Erlang/OTP. I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a major in Computer 
Science and a minor in Religious Studies. When I'm not writing code or blog posts 
I enjoy watching art house films, cheering on my favourite sports teams, and 
playing some groovy tunes on my guitar. </p>
