<p>Hi, I'm Nolan. I'm a software developer with a passion for functional programming,
Haskell, and Rust. </p>

<p>I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a major
in Computer Science and a minor in Religious Studies. When I'm not writing code or
blog posts I enjoy watching art house films, cheering on my favourite teams (New Orleans Saints and Toronto Blue Jays), and playing some groovy tunes on my guitar.</p>
