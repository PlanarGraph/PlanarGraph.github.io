title: About Me
---

Hey, I'm Nolan. I'm a software developer with a passion for functional programming and
type safety. Naturally, this has led me to program in languages like Haskell and Rust,
but lately I have been enjoying programming in Elixir and reaping the benefits of OTP.
I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a major in Computer Science and a 
minor in Religious Studies. When I'm not writing code or blog posts I enjoy watching 
art house films, cheering on my favourite sports teams, and playing some groovy tunes 
on my guitar.
